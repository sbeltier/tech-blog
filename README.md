### Description
The tech blog is a community where users can create blog posts and comment on others' work.

### Usage
The dashboard includes the current blog posts users have created. Click on any of them to view the post and its corresponding comments. 

### Installation
The Tech Blog uses the following npm packages: bcrypt, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, sequelize, tailwind

After cloning the repository, prepare your Node.js environment by opening your command-line and typing:
npm install

This will install the latest npm packages required to run this application.

Next, create a .env file and include mysql credentials for the variables DB_NAME, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_USER.

Now is the time to update the seeds file as you see fit. If you would like to use the existing seeds, type: npm run seed

Once the configuration and seeds are set, you're ready to launch the app! Type: npm run start.

### Future Development
Future improvements need to be made to make this app more functional. The  next update for the tech blog will give users the ability to create an account, login and logout, and update and delete both comments and posts.
